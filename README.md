# Front-End Boile-Plate

This is a basic frontend boilerplate I tend to use,  
either with static HTML or using hugo static generator.  

The only dependancy is libararies/oocss called from style.scss.  
I like to keep the sass components and global variables separate from the main repo.  
that way I can keep the pandacss as a 'black box' with elementary things I use in all projects.  

- Clone [PandaCSS](https://github.com/iwfmp/pandacss)
```
git clone https://github.com/iwfmp/pandacss.git scss/libraries/oocss
```
